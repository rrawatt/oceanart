# OceanArt

This is a simple Python-based simulation game built using the `pygame` library. The game renders a dynamic environment featuring a day-night cycle, beach, clouds, sun, moon, and stars. It demonstrates the interaction between different elements of nature, such as the movement of the sun, moon, and clouds, alongside a constantly shifting sky.

## Requirements

Before running the simulation, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **pygame**: A library used to create video games and graphical simulations.
- **sunmoon.py**: Custom module that defines the behavior of the sun and moon.
- **stars.py**: Custom module for star generation and animation.
- **clouds.py**: Custom module to create and animate clouds.
- **beach.py**: Custom module to render and animate the beach.
- **island.py**: Custom module to render the island background.

You can install `pygame` by running the following:

```bash
pip install pygame
